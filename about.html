    <h1>More Than an Institute.<br>A <em>Standard</em> of Excellence.</h1>
    <p>Since 2009, Premier Language Institute has set the benchmark for English language education — combining rigorous academic standards with genuine care for every student who walks through our doors.</p>

    <span class="section-label">Our Story</span>
    <h2>Founded on the Belief That<br><em>Excellence</em> Is for Everyone</h2>
    <p>Premier Language Institute was established in 2009 by Dr. Margaret Clarke, a Cambridge-trained linguist with a clear and urgent conviction: that access to truly excellent English language education should not be reserved for a privileged few. After more than a decade teaching at leading universities across the United Kingdom and Australia, Dr. Clarke returned home determined to build something different — an institution where rigour and warmth existed not in opposition, but in concert.</p>
    <p>What began as twelve students and two teachers in a converted townhouse has grown, over fifteen years, into one of the most respected language institutions in the region. Today, Premier Language Institute serves learners from more than 45 countries, employs over 30 credentialed educators, and has guided more than 12,000 graduates toward their professional, academic, and personal goals.</p>
    <p>Our growth has never diluted our founding standards. Classes remain small and purposefully intimate. Every student is assessed individually and placed in the programme best suited to their level and ambitions. Every teacher is selected not only for their qualifications — though these are exceptional — but for their genuine commitment to student success.</p>
    <p>At Premier Language Institute, we measure our success not in enrolment figures but in outcomes: exam scores achieved, promotions earned, universities entered, and the quiet, profound confidence our graduates carry with them long after they leave our classrooms. That is the Premier standard — and it is one we hold ourselves to every single day.</p>

    <span class="section-label">What We Stand For</span>
    <h2 class="section-title">Our Mission &amp; Core Values</h2>
    <p class="section-sub">These six principles are not aspirational slogans. They are the criteria against which every decision at Premier Language Institute is made.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="values-grid">
    <div class="value-card reveal">
      <div class="value-number">01</div>
      <div class="value-icon">🎯</div>
      <h3>Academic Rigour</h3>
      <p>We hold ourselves to the highest academic standards in everything we do — from curriculum design to lesson delivery to assessment. Our programmes are evidence-based, independently reviewed, and continuously refined.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="value-card reveal">
      <div class="value-number">02</div>
      <div class="value-icon">❤️</div>
      <h3>Student-Centred Learning</h3>
      <p>Every student at PLI receives an individual assessment, a personalised learning plan, and ongoing support tailored to their progress. We never apply a one-size-fits-all approach.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="value-card reveal">
      <div class="value-number">03</div>
      <div class="value-icon">🌍</div>
      <h3>Global Perspective</h3>
      <p>Our classrooms bring together students from dozens of cultures and countries. We actively cultivate this diversity as a pedagogical strength — learning to communicate across cultures is as valuable as the language itself.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="value-card reveal">
      <div class="value-number">04</div>
      <div class="value-icon">📊</div>
      <h3>Measurable Results</h3>
      <p>We make commitments to outcomes, not intentions. Our student progression data is tracked, reviewed, and published transparently. If a student is not meeting targets, our faculty intervenes proactively.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="value-card reveal">
      <div class="value-number">05</div>
      <div class="value-icon">🤝</div>
      <h3>Professional Integrity</h3>
      <p>We operate with complete transparency in our admissions, pricing, and programme standards. The PLI reputation has been built over fifteen years of consistently doing what we say we will do.</p>
